## Submit a talk/workshop
If you want to submit a talk for upcoming events, then you can create a new issue on this repository. Just fill in the requested details and one of us will take care of scheduling the talk/workshop.

When a talk/workshop proposal is created, it gets labeled with talk-proposal. Once it's confirmed and the date is decided, scheduled label will be added to it.

After the event, the event page will be updated with summary, slides and code snippets of the talk. Once done, the issue will be closed.

This format has been adopted by Python Pune meetup group.
